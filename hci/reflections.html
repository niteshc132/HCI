                    The topic we chose to investigate was Apple trackpad comfort/reliability vs 
					laptop brand trackpads. We chose this topic as laptops are a heavily relied 
					on and used piece of technology today and is debated among laptop users what 
					laptops have the best trackpad. The comfort of a trackpad can be the make or 
					break factor of whether to purchase a laptop, so we wanted to see what brand
					made the best trackpad.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My main job was writing the Introduction and hypothesis, as well as providing
					one of the three laptops that we used in the study, that being a Dell. All team 
					members participated in conducting the study and each setup our own laptops in 
					preparation for it. Since our main point was about the comfortability we decided 
					that participants should use each laptop, go through a mouse accuracy test and 
					once completed on all laptops, give us feedback on which laptop they liked the 
					most and felt the most comfortable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our study had 10 participants. This netted us a total of 10 sets of data that we 
					could make our conclusion upon. The results from our tests were in line with 
					what we hypothesised. The LG laptop came out with the lowest scores out of all 
					three laptops, the Dell results showed that it was the second best of the three 
					with very close Efficiency, Accuracy and comfort to the Apple laptop. Finally, 
					they reflected that Apple was in fact the most comfortable laptop among the three 
					that we used and therefore what we theorised was correct.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although what we hypothesized was correct and the results we received proved 
					that, I believe that a larger data set is required to show a more rounded true 
					depiction of what laptop is the best of the three. This could have been achieved 
					by testing over multiple days or even by having participants go through the 
					test’s multiple times on the testing day.

                <p>
                    I'm in my third year of majoring in software engineering in a Bachelor of Computational
					and Information Sciences. I also have a passion for hardware. I try keep up to date
					with the latest products that are being released. I've enjoyed reading other
					experiments performed on various hardware products online. I couldn't find another
					experiment that tested trackpads.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The reason for our methodology was because trackpads can have quite a subjective
					opinion for every user. It would be impossible to find the best trackpad as everyone
					would have different opinions on it. To measure this we conducted surveys. We felt 
					it was still important to have an objective value to measure. Having the subjects
					perform a mouse accuracy test, we felt was the best. An objective identifier for
					a good trackpad would be how accurate you can be with it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We conducted the experiment over 4 hours in one day. We used Caleb's, Ray's and my
					laptops for the experiment. As it was the easiest to get hold of. If we had a better
					choice of models we would've used different laptops.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What we found was that the total score from the mouse accuracy test for the LG laptop
					was significantly lower compared to the other laptops. Only 20% of the participants
					had LG as the 2nd highest total score and 0% as LG for the highest total score. While
					Apple and Dell were very closer, Dell took the slight edge over. 60% of participants
					had Dell as their highest total score with the other 40% having Apple.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After seeing these results I was expecting to see a similar spread for the
					comfortability. However, this time Apple took the slight edge over Dell. LG was still
					very behind. This has lead me to think that performance doesn't equate with the
					users preference for trackpad.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We were worried that people that regularly use trackpads could skew the data one way.
					However, every participate said that they regularly use trackpads.
					Regular gamers did generally score higher than non-gamers. However, dividing the group
					did not change the final rankings of models. Regular gamers still had a preference
					for Apple and non-gamers still had a preference Apple.
					I thought this would have had a more significant affect on the results. With gamers
					preferring the higher performanced model.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One thing we forgot to control during the experiment was the mouse sensitivity. This
					would have affected performance more than preference. After reflecting on that though
					we might not have been able to control anyway. We should've had the same DPI for every
					trackpad, but the Apple has no way of setting the exact DPI. Instead it just has
					an arbitrarily measured scale.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One way to improve the expirement would've been to have more tests and over a longer
					time. This would've helped get a more accurate performance for each participant. And
					also have the participants get more time with the laptops to rate the trackpad more
					accurately.

                <p>
                    I am in my third year of majoring in software development in Bachelor 
					of Computer and Information Sciences. As an software development major 
					student, conducting an experiment regarding computer hardware, it was 
					very interesting as it was a field that is very closely related to my 
					major but something I would not encounter during my studies. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    My role in the project was to gather participants for the survey. Adding 
					contents on hypothesis and survey questions. Set Variables.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I thought there will be no difference between apple track pad and other 
					brands’ track pad because, nowadays, most of laptops’ track pad do not 
					have difference on their looking. Therefore, the results from Mouse Accuracy 
					test would be similar for all participants. The only thing that can influence 
					the results would be that participants would progressively get used to the test, 
					therefore receiving higher scores for track pads that were used later on during 
					the research. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    My initial thoughts have been changed through this research. There was a bigger 
					difference in the track pads than what I had anticipated. The results showed 
					that the LG track pad had a significantly lower score in comparison to the other 
					two brands in both the performance section and comfort wise. If the scores had a 
					linear increase in between brands, I would’ve thought my prediction was somewhat 
					correct but with similar scores shown between Apple and Dells’ track pad, it has 
					proved that my prediction was incorrect.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our tests were conducted under the same conditions for every participant.
					Tests were only conducted between 12PM – 2PM at the same location, laptop 
					settings and test program/website setting. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Following the results, it shows that Dell received the highest score regarding 
					accuracy while Apple’s track pad was found to be the most comfortable. Dell and 
					Apples’ difference in scores were very small while LG’s track pad had a significantly 
					bad performance overall. As our hypothesis, people did find that the Apple laptop was
					the most comfortable and Dell the most accurate but we may say that the score 
					difference between these two brands are insignificant as it is very minor. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    There were a few flaws that made the test unfair and therefore, unreliable results.
					Firstly, the 3 laptops of different brands were not set at an equal sensitivity 
					level regarding the track pad. To overcome this, all mouse sensitivity levels 
					should’ve been set at an equal DPI. Secondly, the condition of laptops were 
					different. For example, age of model, specification differences, etc. The most 
					ideal way would’ve been to use brand new laptops for each brand but as students 
					this was something that we could not do. Lastly, having a wider range of 
					participants would’ve made our test fairer. A wider range of participants 
					regarding age, gender and previous experiences with track pads would improve 
					the reliability.
