We want to compare how different participants perform using the drawing tablet compared with hand drawn. We also want to see if their performance compares whether they commonly use a drawing tablet.

                <h2>Hypothesis</h2>
                <br>

                <p>Participants that have no prior experience with a drawing tablet would prefer pen and paper as that’s what they are familiar and comfortable with.
				</p>
				<p>
We assume that the drawing tablet would have a learning curve to it, therefore people that are familiar and commonly use drawing tablets would prefer the tablet over hand drawing.

                <h2>Method</h2>

                <p>
We are going to set up a comparison test where a volunteer participant will use a drawing tablet and pen and paper to draw multiple shapes and then compare the outcome of their drawing to “perfect” examples to rate them based on accuracy. We will also ask each participant which they prefer. The drawing tablet we will be using will be the Surface Pro 6 with Surface Pen.

                </p>
				<p>On the 10th of October, during the time period of 2:00pm - 4:00pm, we conducted our experiment.
