                <h3>Conclusion</h3>

                <p>This study shows that most performance scores were higher for the Dell Trackpad.
				Scores for the LG were noticeably lower compared to the other two. We didn't test
				to see whether scores were improved over time which could've affected the results
				of the test.</p>
                <p>Although LG performed better, the test subjects preferred using the apple trackpad.
				This leads us to conclude that performance doesn't directly link to a user's preference
				over trackpads. </p>
				<p>We noticed that people that said they are regular gamers performed better than those
				that arem't regular gamers. The gamers generally preferred Dell over Apple, while high
				performing non-gamers generally preferred Apple over Dell.
                <p>During the experiment, the test subjects were very vocal about their distaste for
				LG and their liking for Apple or Dell.</p>
				<p>It is important to note that these trackpads do not directly corelate the quality of
				these brands trackpads, but rather the quality of these specific models. The models compared
				do not fit within the same budget range. The LG and Dell laptops are quite modern laptops
				with the MacBook Pro being almost 6 years older than both of them. These results can actually
				show that Apple has managed to successfully give what customers want with their trackpads
				for years, while other brands are still trying to catch up.
